            <p>QuickSwitch is our easy-to-use solution for seamless switching between addresses. This means an attacker has to start all over again whether they are just starting or have gained persistence. By swapping the IPv4 and v6 addresses and flushing all caches. Compatible with Suricata, Snort, Wireshark, Windows, and Linux.</p>
            <p>Price: $249.99</p>
            <p>Installation and Consultation available for $59. Negotiable on price if you have a module I don't have here.</p>
